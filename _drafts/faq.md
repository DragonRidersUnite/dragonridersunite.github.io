## What's with the whole "dragon rider" thing? Seems kinda lame. I've got a fancy car in my two car garage and an electric juicer and don't have time for silly things like dragons and riding them.

Let loose, have some fun, be a little silly.

## What is the difference between DragonRuby and DragonRuby Game Toolkit (DRGTK)?
